## Imperial College London COVID-19 Model

This subdirectory contains data produced and made publicly available by the Imperial College London COVID-19 Model website.

Additional details about this model and its underlying data and assumptions can be found on the [MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis's website](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/covid-19/covid-19-weekly-forecasts/week-07-04-2020/). Data were accessed from this website on 4/8/20 at 9:30am PT from a [publicly accessable RShiny app](https://sangeetabhatia03.github.io/covid19-short-term-forecasts/index.html) for each of three distinct modeling approaches, plus an overall unweighted ensemble model produced on the basis of these three models.

Data will be updated weekly as Imperial College London COVID-19 Model releases new modeling results. Note that as of 4/15/2020 at 12:45pm PT, the links above are no longer accessible. Source code for the shiny app is still available on [github](https://github.com/sangeetabhatia03/covid19-short-term-forecasts).
