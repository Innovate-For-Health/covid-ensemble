# COVID-19 Model Inventory and Archive

## This work is still in progress.

This project was developed to facilitate open-source, reproducible epidemiological modeling for COVID-19 response and recovery. We are working to create an overarching data and modeling architecture to allow multiple validated models, developed by public health experts, to be compared via a consolidated platform both individually and as an ensemble. These efforts are similar to the approaches used to model hurricanes based on the consensus of separate models.

This effort will enable public health experts, policy-makers, and data scientists to make direct and meaningful comparisons between model results (e.g., projected caseload over time) under different sets of assumptions, input data, and modeling approaches.
