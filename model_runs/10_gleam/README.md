## GLEAM model

This subdirectory contains US state-level data produced and made publicly available by the the GLEAM team, including collaborators from Northeastern University, the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, University of Florida, NIH Fogarty Center, the Institute for Scientific Interchange (ISI) Foundation, and the Bruno Kessler Foundation.

Additional details about this model, its underlying data and assumptions, and the full team that develops and maintains the model, can be found on the [GLEAM COVID-19 website](https://covid19.gleamproject.org/). Data are updated every 1-2 weeks and are and accessed via a publicly accessible API. Data were last pulled and updated in this repository on June 15, 2020, accessing data from June 7, 2020.

GLEAM reports data per US state. The model inventory currently includes only results from the "mitigated" scenarios described by GLEAM, excluding estimates of infections and fatalities from an entirely unmitigated scenario. Results accessed from the API are rounded to the nearest full number in order to remain consistent with the results reported on the GLEAM website.
