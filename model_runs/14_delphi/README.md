# COVID-19 Model Archive

## MIT DELPHI Model

This subdirectory contains US state and country-level data produced and made publicly available from the MIT DELPHI Model developed and maintained by a team of Operations Researchers at MIT.

Additional details about this model, its underlying data and assumptions, and the full team of researchers and core team members who contribute to the model can be found on the [DELPHI Model model website](https://www.covidanalytics.io/projections). Data are updated regularly and are and accessed via the site's "download data" functionality as a .csv file. Data were last pulled and updated in this repository on July 15, 2020.

While this model resports subnational-level results from countries other than the US, the model archive currently only incorporates subnational-level estimates for the United States (e.g., state-level data), and national-level estimates from all other locations. The model's data export reports cumulative fatalities (as "detected deaths"), and daily fatalities are calculated as daily difference between estimates of detected deaths.
