3	2	Neher COVID-19 Scenarios	4/6/20	"Model run using default parameters plus website, plus US population data from US Census (total population = 327,167,439), and US COVID-19 caseload data from US CDC accessed morning of 4/6/2020 (cumulative cases = 330,891), which is almost certainly an understimate as it suggests a CFR of over 2.6% in the US. Assume ""strong"" mitigation and run scenario from April 6 through September 1, 2020. All input assumptions documented in data structure stored in model_export/ subdirectory."
