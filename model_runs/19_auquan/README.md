# COVID-19 Model Inventory and Archive

This subdirectory contains state and country-level data produced and made publicly available by Auquan Data Science and accessed via the [Reich Lab COVID-19 github page](https://github.com/reichlab/covid19-forecast-hub/blob/master/data-processed/Auquan-SEIR/metadata-Auquan-SEIR.txt). 

Additional details about this model and its underlying data and assumptions can be found at Auquan's COVID-19 [website](https://covid19-infection-model.auquan.com/). Data are updated regularly on the Reich Lab COVID-19 Github page and will regularly be pulled and archived by this model inventory. Data were last updated in this repository on July 14, 2020, based on data through July 5, 2020.

As of data from July 5, 2020, daily estimates of cumulative fatalities are not longer reported, only weekly estimates. Due to this change, it is no longer possible to calculate daily fatalities from available data.
