## UCLA COVID-19 Model

This subdirectory contains US state-level estimates made publicly available by the Statistical Machine Learning Lab at UCLA.

Additional details about this model and its underlying data and assumptions can be found online at [covid19.uclaml.org](https://covid19.uclaml.org/index.html). Data are updated regularly and accessed via a publicly available github gist account associated with the covid19 site above. Data were last pulled and updated in this repository on June 25, 2020.

The model's data export reports cumulative fatalities, and daily fatalities are calculated within the model archive based on the daily difference between estimates of cumulative fatalities. All reported estimates are rounded to the nearest full number, consistent with how they are reported on the group's website.
