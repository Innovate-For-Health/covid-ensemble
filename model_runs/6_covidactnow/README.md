# COVID-19 Model Inventory and Archive

## COVID Act Now (covidactnow.org) model

This subdirectory contains state-level data produced and made publicly available by the COVIDactnow.org website and accessed via a public API.

Additional details about this model and its underlying data and assumptions can be found on the [COVID Act Now website](https://covidactnow.org/). Data are updated daily via the COVID Act Now website and will regularly be pulled and archived by this model inventory. Data were last pulled and updated in this repository on June 8, 2020. COVID Act Now reports hospital bed requirements for each US state and DC. Total bed requirements for the US are estimated by summing available estimates as reported across states and DC. Estimates of daily fatalities were calculated based on reported cumulative fatalities per day, assuming that all measurements reported on a given day were as of the end of that day.
