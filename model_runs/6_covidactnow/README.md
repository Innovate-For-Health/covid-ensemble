# COVID-19 Model Inventory and Archive

## COVID Act Now (covidactnow.org) model

This subdirectory contains data produced and made publicly available by the COVIDactnow.org website.

Additional details about this model and its underlying data and assumptions can be found on the [COVID Act Now website](https://covidactnow.org/). This data extraction process is not yet automated and needs work -- for now, data were manually pulled from the website and double checked, for California only, as of 3pm PT on 4/7/20. We still need to find a more automated way to access the model outputs that are being displayed live on the site, by state and county.
